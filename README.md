# Spickerrr - A simple Android App to display petitions to Pirateparty conventions

This repository contains the code for one of my first Android Projects - Spickerrr. It's kind of an educational project for me,
but is intended to run on the phone of many pirates.

So in case you have any suggestions or notes, do not hesitate to contact me.

I'll work on this whenever I find the time to!
